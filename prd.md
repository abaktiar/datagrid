# Product Requirements Document: @abaktiar/datagrid

## 1. Introduction

**Product Name:** @abaktiar/datagrid

**Product Goal:** To create a highly performant, visually appealing, and feature-rich DataGrid/Table component for React applications, built upon the headless foundation of TanStack Table (v8+). @abaktiar/datagrid aims to provide developers with a powerful, customizable, and easy-to-integrate solution for displaying and interacting with tabular data, suitable for publishing as an NPM package with minimal external dependencies.

**Problem Statement:** Existing DataGrid solutions can be overly complex, bloated with dependencies, difficult to customize aesthetically, or lacking in essential features. Developers need a lightweight yet powerful table component that offers a modern, sleek user experience out-of-the-box, while also providing deep customization capabilities.

**Vision:** @abaktiar/datagrid will be the go-to DataGrid component for React developers who value performance, modern aesthetics, extensive features, and a lean footprint.

## 2. Goals and Objectives

* **Deliver a best-in-class developer experience:** Easy installation, clear API, comprehensive documentation, and TypeScript support.
* **Provide extensive built-in features:** Cover all common DataGrid functionalities like sorting, filtering, pagination, selection, resizing, etc.
* **Ensure high performance:** Optimized for large datasets, smooth interactions, and efficient rendering, leveraging TanStack Table's capabilities and virtualization.
* **Offer deep customization:** Allow developers to tailor the look, feel, and behavior of the table to fit their application's specific needs. This includes custom renderers for cells, headers, and other UI elements.
* **Maintain a minimal footprint:** Limit external dependencies to keep the package size small and reduce potential conflicts. Styling should be achievable with pure CSS, CSS Modules, or a very lightweight, opt-in styling solution.
* **Achieve a modern and sleek aesthetic:** The default styling should be beautiful, intuitive, and professional.
* **Ensure accessibility:** Adhere to WAI-ARIA standards for table components.

## 3. Target Audience

* **React Developers:** Building web applications that require sophisticated data display and interaction.
* **UI/UX Designers:** Looking for a DataGrid component that can be easily styled to match modern design systems.
* **Enterprises & Startups:** Needing a reliable and performant table solution for internal tools, dashboards, and customer-facing applications.
* **Open Source Contributors:** Interested in using or contributing to a high-quality table component.

## 5. Non-Functional Requirements

* **Performance:**
    * Fast initial render time.
    * Smooth scrolling and interactions, even with thousands of rows (with virtualization).
    * Efficient updates when data or state changes.
    * Target <100ms interaction response time for common operations.
* **Bundle Size:**
    * Core component should be lightweight. Target a gzipped bundle size competitive with other modern table libraries (e.g., < 50KB for core functionality, excluding TanStack Table itself).
    * Minimize external dependencies. Any included styling solution should be minimal or opt-in.
* **Accessibility (A11y):**
    * Adherence to WCAG 2.1 AA guidelines.
    * Proper ARIA attributes for table, rows, cells, headers, sort controls, pagination, etc.
    * Full keyboard navigability (tabbing through interactive elements, arrow keys for cell navigation, Enter/Space for actions).
    * Sufficient color contrast in default themes.
* **Browser Compatibility:**
    * Latest two versions of major modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).
* **Maintainability:**
    * Clean, well-commented, and modular codebase.
    * Unit and integration tests covering core functionalities.
    * Consistent coding style.
* **Security:**
    * Ensure no XSS vulnerabilities from data rendering (TanStack Table helps, but custom renderers need care).
* **Extensibility:**
    * Design APIs and component structures to be easily extendable for custom features.
    * Consider a plugin architecture for more advanced, optional functionalities.

## 6. Design and UX Considerations

* **Aesthetics:**
    * **Modern & Sleek:** Clean lines, appropriate use of white space, subtle animations/transitions for interactions (e.g., sort, expand).
    * **Professional:** Suitable for enterprise applications.
    * **Visually Appealing:** Not cluttered, easy on the eyes.
* **Interactions:**
    * **Intuitive:** Users should understand how to interact with the table without explicit instructions.
    * **Responsive Feedback:** Clear visual feedback for actions like sorting, selecting, resizing.
    * **Ergonomic:** Controls should be easy to click/tap.
* **Customization:**
    * Provide sensible defaults but allow extensive styling overrides.
    * CSS variables are highly recommended for easy theming.
* **Density:**
    * Option to control table density (compact, comfortable, spacious) to suit different use cases.

## 7. Technical Considerations

* **Core Library:** TanStack Table (React Table v8 or latest) as the headless engine.
* **Framework:** React 17+ (or latest stable).
* **Language:** TypeScript.
* **Styling:**
    * **Primary Approach:** Pure CSS / CSS Modules. Provide a default stylesheet that is highly customizable via CSS variables and class overrides.
    * **Alternative (Opt-in):** Consider a very lightweight, performant CSS-in-JS solution (e.g., Emotion, Styled Components if absolutely necessary and can be tree-shaken effectively, or a custom utility-first approach). The goal is to avoid heavy dependencies.
    * No reliance on large UI frameworks like Material UI, Ant Design, etc., for core components to maintain leanness.
* **Build System:** Rollup, esbuild, or Webpack configured for optimal bundle size and formats (ESM, CJS, UMD).
* **Testing:** Jest, React Testing Library for unit and integration tests.
* **Version Control:** Git (e.g., GitHub).
* **Package Management:** NPM/Yarn for publishing.

## 8. Success Metrics

* **Adoption:** Number of NPM downloads, projects using the component.
* **Community Engagement:** GitHub stars, forks, contributions, issues, and discussions.
* **Performance Benchmarks:** Comparison with other popular table libraries.
* **Bundle Size:** Achieved gzipped size.
* **User Satisfaction:** Positive feedback, low rate of bug reports related to core functionality.
* **Documentation Quality:** Positive feedback on clarity and completeness of docs.

## 9. Future Considerations (Potential Roadmap Items)

* **Advanced Grouping & Pivoting:** More complex data transformation and display.
* **Server-Side Operations Utilities:** Helper functions or hooks to simplify integration with backends for server-side sorting, filtering, and pagination.
* **Drag-and-Drop Rows:** For reordering data within the table.
* **Tree Grids:** Support for hierarchical data display within the grid structure.
* **Print View:** Optimized styling for printing.
* **Accessibility Audit:** Formal audit by an accessibility expert.
* **Pre-built Themes:** Offer a small selection of professionally designed themes beyond the default.

## 10. Open Questions

* What is the exact strategy for styling to balance customizability, performance, and bundle size? (e.g., CSS variables vs. a minimal theming API via JS).
* Which virtualization library will be used/integrated, or will a custom one be built? (React Virtual, React Window, or custom).
* Specific set of filter types to support out-of-the-box for column filters.
